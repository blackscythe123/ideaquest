  "transcript": " No matter what you are shooting is that a cooking video, makeup video, YouTube video or just a read you need to have this one skill and that is speaking in front of the camera. So when I started I was very bad at it. So how did I improve? Simple, I forced myself to speak in my Insta stories and at that time I was not confident so I was putting that on my close friends list. And slowly and steadily I got comfortable so I started to put that in my normal story. See, your first time speaking in front of the camera is going to suck. So don't give up. Try it again and again and eventually you are going to get better at it.",
